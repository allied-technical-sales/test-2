SQL test

1. Write a single table that has a parent - child relationship with itself, as well as a varchar(100) field for `name`. 
2. Populate the table with some data.
3. Write a function that will return all of the children for a given id.
4. Write a function that will return all of the ancestors for a given id.

What we are looking for: 

1. clarification on all steps.
2. proper indexing


We prefer to have the answers to tests submitted via pull request, but in the case of SQL test, it is ok to simply email the final .sql file(s) to hr@atsspec.ca.
